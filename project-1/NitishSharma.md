-Role- To develop a javascript file of library.json from XML file.
-Decription- My name is nitish sharma and my role was to design a javascript file of our project topic
called library. We were provided with json. First, we created a XML file, then my role was to create a js(JavaScript) file of it

For this, i have taken a little help from my team members and worked together on the whole project.
I also had a minimal help from the traslator tool which we were provided in our course outline. Also i have watched some informative videos on youtube which really helped me to get to know javascript better.

Adding to this, I have also read lecture pdf's which were provided to us to understand how to develop this file.
